# Oakland Community ERC-1155 NFT Project

## Overview

The Oakland Community ERC-1155 NFT Project aims to raise funds for the Oakland community by minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs) created by talented artists from Oakland. This documentation provides a step-by-step guide on how to create and deploy the ERC-1155 smart contract, mint NFTs, and manage the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Solidity development environment setup with foundry
- Ethereum wallet private key or knowledge to create one in forge
- Basic knowledge of Solidity and Ethereum development

## Getting Started

To get started with the Oakland Community ERC-1155 NFT Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install project dependencies: `forge install`
3. compile the smart contracts `forge build`
4. Configure the project settings in the `foundry.toml` file.

## Smart Contract Development

The smart contract development process involves creating an ERC-1155 contract that supports the creation and management of NFTs. The following steps outline the development process:

1. Define the contract structure, including the necessary data structures and functions.
2. Implement the ERC-1155 standard functions, such as `balanceOf`, `mint`, `burn`, etc.
3. Add additional project-specific functionality, such as metadata management, royalty distribution, etc.
4. Test the smart contract using a local development environment or testnet.
5. Optimize and secure the contract code as needed.

## Deployment

To deploy the ERC-1155 smart contract, follow these steps:

1. Compile the smart contract code.
2. Select the desired Ethereum network for deployment (testnet or mainnet).
3. Deploy the smart contract using a deployment script
4. Verify the contract on the chosen blockchain explorer.
5. Record the deployed contract address for future reference.
